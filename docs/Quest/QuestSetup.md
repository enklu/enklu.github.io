1. **Adjustment wheel** - Turning the adjustment wheel counterclockwise extends the headband. Turning the adjustment wheel clockwise tightens the headband.
2. **Power button** - Pressing the power button turns the device on. Pressing the power button while the device is on causes it to sleep. To turn the device off, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds or until all 5 LED indicators fade out.
3. **LED indicators** - When the device is powered on, the LED indicators display the battery level. Each LED represents roughly 20% of the overall battery level. The battery is fully charged when all 5 LEDs are lit.
4. **USB Type-C charging port** - The HoloLens 2 comes with a USB-C cable and an 18W charger. This port may also be used to connect the device to a computer.
5. **Overhead strap** - The overhead strap is adjustable and may also be detached.
6. **Brightness buttons** - The front brightness button increases display brightness. The other brightness button decreases display brightness.
7. **Volume buttons** - The front volume button increases device volume. The other volume button decreases device volume.

### Care & Safe Handling

Keep your device away from direct sunlight to avoid damaging the lens. Exposure to direct sunlight for less than a minute can cause serious damage to your headset. 

When putting on the device, first adjust the lenses by shifting them until they are in a position that allows you to see clearly. Adjust the side straps by moving the two sliders on either side of the top strap. Once these are set, adjust the top strap by pulling apart the velcro and reattaching it until comfortable and the screen is in full view. When removing the device, 

Use a microfiber cloth to the clean your headset and controllers. Do not use alcohol based wipes or solvents on the display or sensors. The Quest 2 headstrap may be cleaned using a microfiber cloth with mild soap and cold water. Never submerge the device in water or apply water directly to the device.

## Enklu App

### Accessing the Enklu App

> **Note**: The Enklu Cloud App on the Oculus Quest is currently at an early stage of development. As a result, you won't be able to find it on the Oculus Store just yet. If you'd like to check out the Quest Port, please [reach out](/contact) and we'll give you access ASAP!

From the Start menu, locate and open the Microsoft Store app. Within the Microsoft Store app, use the search bar at the top to search "Enklu".

Navigate to the Enklu app page and select **Get**. You may be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account, then the Enklu app will begin installing. Once the Enklu app has finished installing, you may launch the app from either the Microsoft Store, or from the Windows Start menu.

### Launching the Enklu App

A white application window will open momentarily before the display switches to fullscreen mode. An Enklu "E" logo appears when the application is starting. If an existing instance of the Enklu app is already running, the app will load into where the user left off when the app was last in use.

When launching the app for the first time\*, the default demo experience will be loaded. Feel free to walk around the environment learning about what different elements of an experience can be built. All buttons in Enklu can be activated with your gaze by moving the center of the device to match with the center of the button. If the scene content isn't positioned nicely in front of you or is otherwise inaccessible, say the phrase "*Debug*, *Origin*" (with a slight pause between the words) to re-position the experience at the center of your view.
