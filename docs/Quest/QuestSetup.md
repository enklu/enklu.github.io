## Oculus Quest 2 Device Operation

### Care & Safe Handling

Keep your device away from direct sunlight to avoid damaging the lens. Exposure to direct sunlight for less than a minute can cause serious damage to your headset. 

When putting on the device, first adjust the lenses by shifting them until they are in a position that allows you to see clearly. Adjust the side straps by moving the two sliders on either side of the top strap. Once these are set, adjust the top strap by pulling apart the velcro and reattaching it until comfortable and the screen is in full view. When removing the device, 

Use a microfiber cloth to the clean your headset and controllers. Do not use alcohol based wipes or solvents on the display or sensors. The Quest 2 headstrap may be cleaned using a microfiber cloth with mild soap and cold water. Never submerge the device in water or apply water directly to the device.
