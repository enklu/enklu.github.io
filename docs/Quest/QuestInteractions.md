## Interacting with UI Elements

In the Enklu app, interacting with UI and scene elements can be accomplished in two ways.

The first is by **Gaze**, signified by a white reticle that follows a user's head. When a user fixes their gaze on the center of an element (such as a button), they will be able to activate it regardless of its distance.

The second method is by using the **right Touch controller**. While in the Enklu app, a blue "interaction ray" extends out from the right Touch controller. This ray acts very similarly to gaze, so pointing the ray in the middle of an interactive element will also activate it.

## Moving Around a Scene

If a user's guardian is too small relative to a scene, or if they are using a seated/stationary guardian, they can still move about the scene using the joystick on the right controller. 

When the joystick is pushed upward, an arrow icon will appear on the floor of a scene, along with a green "fishing line" that runs from the arrow to the right controller. Once the user releases the joystick, they will then teleport to the location of the arrow icon.

A user can also determine which direction they will face after they teleport. Turning the joystick before initiating the teleport will also turn the arrow icon on the floor. The direction this arrow is facing will dictate where a user will face post-teleport.

## Leaving an Experience

If at any time you would like to exit an experience, press the *Menu* button on left Touch controller. 
This will bring up the **Experience Menu**, which will display the name of the current experience as well as a back button to return to the **My Experiences** browser.
