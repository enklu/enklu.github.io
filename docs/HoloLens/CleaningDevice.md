# Cleaning Your HoloLens

With the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, HoloLens hygiene is increasingly important. HoloLens devices should be properly cleaned or maintained just like phones and laptops.  

Hereâ€™s how to clean your HoloLens 1 or 2:

1. Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds.
2. Disinfect your work area. This can be done with household products (consider using products that contain more than 40% alcohol). Let the surface dry or wipe down with a paper towel before placing a HoloLens on it.
3. For a Hololens 2 deep cleaning, please remove the brow pad. This pad is magnetically connected to the inside-front of the device (forehead area). Pull gently away to detach and set it aside.

4. Next, clean the visor by first removing any dust with a lens brush or lens blower.
5. Lightly moisten a cloth by using medical "70%" isopropyl alcohol, and then gently wipe the visor.

6. Let the visor dry completely.
7. Clean all other parts of the device, including the brow pad, with an antibacterial gym wipes or a lint-free microfiber cloth moistened with water and a mild antibiotic soap.
8. Pay close attention when cleaning cameras, sensors, mics, speakers, charging port, power button, and volume buttons. These areas are sensitive. Use far less cleaner and a gentler touch on these areas.

9. Do not forget to clean areas that are difficult to access or that reveal themselves when the visor is in the flipped position.
10. Let your HoloLens dry before reuse.

> **Note**: If your workplace has access to ultraviolet (UV) light cleaning devices, consider using these stations between the use of a HoloLens unit. UVC irradiance using UVC LED that operates at 265nm, at intensity level of 0.5-0.6mW/cm2, and does not emit ozone, can be used to sanitize HoloLens.
