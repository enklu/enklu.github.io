Augmented Reality is inherently social, so it's common to want to share your time in an experience with others. 

In any experience, it's possible to start a recording directly in Enklu that gets emailed to you directly. 
No more fussing with cables to export videos off your device anymore.

### Starting a Recording

1. Open the experience menu by saying "menu".
2. Select "Record" with your gaze, and follow the prompt.

While recording is active, the HoloLens will display a recording icon in the upper left corner of the screen. This is not visible in your recordings.

> Note: Recordings capture the visible area where Holograms can be seen. The area outside of the device's Field of View will not be cropped from the final video.

### Stopping a Recording

After you've recorded everything you want, say "stop". You will be notified that the recording is being uploaded.

Check your email, where your video will be sent to you shortly.

### Making the best recording

When making a recording, be mindful that the viewer isn't in control of the device. 
Sharp and sudden movements will appear disorienting when viewing the video.

The best videos often involve slow, comfortable walking and turning speeds.
