## Microsoft Connect App

![Microsoft Connect Icon](/img/LivePreview_ConnectBanner.png)

### Computer

Locate and launch the Microsoft **Connect** app on the target device¹.  Since the **Connect** app is natively bundled into the Windows OS install, the app should be easily found via Windows Search.

> ¹Note that the target device must support Wi-Fi.  It does not have to be connected to a specific Wi-Fi network, but Wi-Fi does need to be enabled on both the target device and the Hololens in order to use the **Connect** app.

When the **Connect** app is launched, it will display the target device's computer name and say it is ready to connect.

### Hololens

On a Hololens, launch and load into the Enklu app.  Once the app has fully loaded, use the bloom gesture for HoloLens (1st gen) or the Start gesture for Hololens 2 to open the Quick Actions Menu².

> ²Note that the Quick Actions Menu is only available within an app.  However outside of an app, the Windows Start menu also has the same option to connect to devices.

Select the **Connect** icon to open a window with available connections.  Then select the computer name of the target device from the list of available connections. Once the Hololens has connected to the computer, the connection window in-lens will close and a live preview will be displayed in the **Connect** app on the computer.
