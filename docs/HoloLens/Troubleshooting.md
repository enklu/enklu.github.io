# Common Issues and Solutions

### "Attempting to locate" content

Move the device, and while facing an open space, do a soft restart.

### "The Space is unable to use"

### The device fails to display content

### The device fails to display content AND doesn't play audio

### The device fails to load the Enklu app, or is stuck during the loading process

### The device cannot disable the pin


# Troubleshooting Steps

For the majority of issues, there are three levels of troubleshooting that you can follow in order:

1. Restarting the headset
2. Deleting and redownloading the Enklu app
3. Doing a factory reset of the headset

## Step 1: Restarting the Headset (2-5 mins)

For most issues (like content not being displayed or audio not loading), a simple device restart should solve the problem. There are two different kinds of restarts:

1. **Soft Restart** (2 min): This will restart the Enklu app (usually solves most content issues). To perform a soft restart, double tap the power button or use the voice command *"Debug, Reset"*.

2. **Hard Restart** (2-5 min): For issues that a soft restart cannot fix, a hard restart is needed. To perform a hard restart, hold down the power button on the back of the headset. After all the LEDs on the device fade out, wait 15 seconds before powering up the device again.

## Step 2: Deleting and Redownloading the Enklu App (7-10 min)

If a hard restart does not solve your issue, then you will likely need to delete and redownload the Enklu app on your device. A delete/reinstall can be done in two ways: either via the Web UI or in headset (if kiosk mode has been disabled).
