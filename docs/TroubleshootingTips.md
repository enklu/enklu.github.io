## Troubleshooting help

If you run across some errors while using Enklu here are a few simple troubleshooting tips you can try. 

First it's recommended to work with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or a variant like [Sidekick](https://www.meetsidekick.com/). 
Second password managers like [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/ ) can be helpful for any login issues. 

### Log-in help

If you run into a log-in issue and have tried to reset your password but had no luck you can reach out to us by [email](contact@enklu.com) or check out our [contact page](https://docs.enklu.com/contact).


### General tips

If you are running into issues, like scenes aren't working correctly or you are getting a bunch of pop-up's about buffer or stack overflow issues check out these tips.

#### Check for code issues

Check your console by going to your Assets window then click on the Log window tab.

Click on the System checkbox and look for noticeable red text. If you are running into a lot of red text you could have a code issue. You can contact us for support or try to work through the issue yourself.

#### Clear cookies/cache

Sometimes clearing cookies/cache can solve some issues. 

Here are two ways you can do this in Chrome.

Common way
[Chrome Clear Cache & Cookies](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050). 

Fast dev way
[Chrome Dev tool Clear Cache & Cookies + Hard Reload](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/05/hard-reload).
Press F12 (opens dev window) then right click on the refresh arrow and hit Empty Cache and Hard Reload 


#### Test your scene in another browser

Is the scene working in another web browser? If it is working in another browser but not your main browser follow the next step below.

#### Factory reset 

If you are still finding pop-ups, the code seems fine in your project, and works in a different browser you may need a factory reset in the browser where scenes won't load. This will clear any extra settings for things like content and turn off any extensions (Won't remove them but will clear their settings so log-in info may be reset and you will need to reenable them). This a good cache all, if you have things like password managers make sure you remember your master password first.
