Different platforms have different needs, which makes Enklu Cloud's automated asset import system a much welcome convenience. Enklu Cloud can take your models (including textures, animations, etc.) and format them for all target platforms automatically. All you need to do is drag and drop.

## Uploading 3D Models

Currently, Enklu Cloud supports two 3D model formats: OBJ and FBX, though more supported formats are on their way.

To import a model, navigate to the Asset Library, click the **+** (plus) icon, and drag your file into the *Drop files here* section. Then click **Upload!** This will upload your asset to Enklu Cloud which will automatically package it for all target platforms. Depending on the size and complexity of your asset, this can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.

Once your model has been uploaded successfully, you will see notifications in the top right corner indicating which platform(s) it has completed processing. In the experience section of the Asset Library, you will see a thumbnail for your newly uploaded asset. Then your model is ready to be used! From here, read about how to [place an asset in the scene](/docs/Assets/PlacingAnAssetInTheScene).

## Uploading 2D Image Assets

You can also upload 2D image assets. Uploading image assets works the same as uploading 3D models. The image file extensions Enklu Cloud supports are:

- .bmp
- .exr
- .gif
- .hdr
- .iff
- .jpg
- .pict
- .png
- .psd
- .pga
- .tiff

> Please note that at this time, your image file extensions must match one of these listed.  For example, you can upload a `.tiff` file, but not a `.tif`.  To upload a `.tif`, you will have to rename the file extension to `.tiff` before attempting to upload it.


## Uploading Audio Files

You can also upload audio files. Uploading audio files works the same as uploading 3D models and 2D images. The audio file extensions Enklu Cloud supports are:

- .mp3
- .ogg
- .wav
- .aiff
- .aif
- .mod
- .it
- .s3m
- .xm  

> Please note that at this time, your audio file extensions must match one of these listed.  For example, you can upload a `.wav` file, but not a `.wave`.  To upload a `.wave`, you will have to rename the file extension to `.wav` before attempting to upload it.
