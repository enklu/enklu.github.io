Enklu Cloud comes with an ever-expanding library of Public Assets. These assets are available to all Enklu Cloud accounts and may be used in any experience.

## Asset Library

The asset library is located below the canvas.  On the left side of the asset library is a list of categories.  The **Public** category is a list of all available public assets in alphabetical order.  Beneath the **Public** category are several other categories that help sort the public assets into more manageable sections.

Our team is always adding to the available public assets, so keep a lookout for more!
