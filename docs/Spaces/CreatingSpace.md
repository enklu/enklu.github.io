A Space links your AR content to the physical world. Your entire experience will perfectly line up with what you see in the Enklu Cloud. A single Space can be used in multiple experiences to help build worlds of adventure in your environment as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started

Creating a Space couldn't be easier. Using your HoloLens 1 or HoloLens 2 device, enter Edit Mode by saying "edit experience". Once in Edit Mode, activate the floating menu and select <b>Spaces</b>.
