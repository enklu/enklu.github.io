The Enklu Web Editor is completely self sufficient and relies solely on your internet connection. However, to take advantage of all the aspects of our platforms, there are some simple hardware and software requirements.

## Hardware

- We do not have strict hardware specifications but a dedicated graphics card is strongly recommended.

- A 3-button mouse: the use of the scroll wheel is important when navigating a scene

- A Microsoft HoloLens: while our runtime can work on most AR HMD, the HoloLens is the most thoroughly tested platform.

## Software

- Google Chrome: while the Web Editor works on most internet browsers, Google Chrome is the most thoroughly tested browser.

- To import Unity prefabs, you will need Unity version **2019.2.0**.
