#### Video Capture

We've made it much easier to capture videos of your experiences -- no code required. You can now start a recording from the main menu (say "Menu" while an experience is playing) or by simply saying "record." Once you've finished, the video
will be delivered to your inbox.

#### Enklu Node SDK

We have created a new [Open Source SDK](https://github.com/enklu/enklu-node-sdk) to help external devices communicate with your experiences.  Connect buttons, talk to your own servers, or even sync your stage lighting! [See our guide](Scripting/NodeSDK) to get started.
