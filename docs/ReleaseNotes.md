## 2020.10.0 - 10/27/2020

### New Features

#### Enklu Embedded

Does your current workflow make you bounce between Unity and the web editor? Have you dreamt of a world where editing an asset in Unity would also edit that asset in the web editor?

Introducing Enklu Embedded in 2020.10! Enklu Embedded allows for users to embed Enklu Cloud content into their Unity scenes. It also enables Unity developers the ability to sync 3D assets from Unity back to Enklu Cloud.

With Enklu Embedded, Unity developers can enjoy the freedom of Unity with the rapid iteration and real-time synchronization of Enklu Cloud (talk about having your cake and eating it too!).

For more information on Enklu Embedded, check out our official guide [here](Embedded/EmbeddedSetup).

#### Web Play Mode

New to Enklu Cloud is Web Play Mode! Web Play Mode allows you to test your experience directly from the web editor, without needing to don a headset. You can switch to Web Play Mode via the Play button at the top of the canvas.

Web Play Mode comes in two varieties: Pop-up and Embedded. You can toggle which one you prefer via the Editor Settings tab (Pop-up is enabled by default).

### Improvements

#### Sharing Experiences

Adding collaborators to your project should be easier than ever with our new sharing experiences UX! We've added a new Share button next to your user portrait that will allow you to add, remove, and adjust the permissions for all collaborators on a project.

For more tips on editing collaborators and permissions, check out our [official guide](WebEditorBasics/SharingExperiences) on sharing your experiences!

#### HoloLens Editor IUX Tweaks

Starting with 2020.10, we'll be rolling out improvements to our HoloLens editor IUX. In 2020.10, we've made selecting buttons via gaze in-lens more ergonomic than ever before! Your gaze should now "stick" to a button when your gaze reticle is close to it. Additionally, you will now experience less gaze "wobble" than before!

#### Loading Screen

Say goodbye to ambiguous black screens! We've added a loading screen to your project window when initializing a project.

### Fixes

#### Misc. Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where refreshing a script did not update it for all collaborators in the project.
    - Removed the refresh button entirely, scripts now refresh automatically.
- Fixed an issue where users could make internal schema properties throw exceptions.
- Users can no longer undo changes made in a previous experience after switching to a different project.

## 2020.9.0 - 9/29/2020

### New Features

#### Post-Processing: Bloom

Have you always wanted to add a satisfying glow to your experiences? Or make your scene look like something out of Tron or a video game? Well, youâ€™re in luck! 

New to Enklu Cloud this release is our first in-editor, post-processing shader: **Bloom**! You can access Bloom settings in your project by navigating to the Scene Settings tab, on the left sidebar of the editor.  

For more information on Bloom, check out our official guide [here](WebEditorBasics/PostProcessing).

### Improvements

#### Scripting UI/UX

Finding and editing a script in Enklu Cloud has never been easier with our improved Scripting UI! Thereâ€™s now a dedicated tab for your Scripts right next to your Assets.

![Script Tab](/img/product/releases/2020.9/script_tab.gif)

Weâ€™ve also reduced the clicks it takes to edit your script, making it even easier to alter your assetâ€™s scripts. Click the thumbnail of the script on an asset, and it will pull it up on the Script tab on the left sidebar of the editor!

![Script Preview](/img/product/releases/2020.9/script_edit.gif)

#### Scene Settings

Along with Bloom comes a UI revamp of the Scene Settings tab on the Hierarchy Window. Weâ€™ve placed each section in their own collapsable menu. This will allow you to find the scene settings you want to change without having to scroll too far.

#### Rendering Performance

Experiences with a very large amount of assets should now see a performance boost! Before, rendering performance would degrade as scene density increased. Now, it will no longer add extra rendering complexity past the expected rendering cost of your asset (which is based on mesh or shader complexity).

### Fixes

#### Live Update

We've fixed a bug that wouldâ€™ve disrupted live updating after a device reconnects to Enklu Cloud after getting disconnected from the internet. Users are now notified upon reconnection if any changes have been made while they were offline.

#### Misc. Bug Fixes

- **Logging**: Introduced the ability to log `null`, and raw json without exceptions.
- **TouchJs**: Adjusted hit.position and hit.normal so that they are now proper Vec3s.
- **Avatar icons**: Fixed an issue that caused leaked icons, missing device thumbnails, and empty abbreviations for the user.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Articulated Hand controller to fail at app start.
- Null scripts are no longer saved in the editor.
- New scripts from collaborators are now acknowledged in the project file.
- Fixed a bug that caused exceptions while using SAI after switching experiences.

#### Video Capture

We've made it much easier to [capture videos of your experiences](HoloLens/VideoRecording) -- no code required. You can now start a recording from the main menu (say "Menu" while an experience is playing) or by simply saying "record." Once you've finished, the video
will be delivered to your inbox.

#### Remote Logging

You can now [stream logs from your HoloLens](HoloLens/RemoteDebugging) to the Enklu Cloud web editor. This greatly improves your ability to debug experiences in real time.

#### Hand Occlusion

On HoloLens 2, [hands can now occlude](HoloLens/Occlusion) holograms in an experience. This feature is opt-in and can be enabled in the Enklu Cloud web editor.

#### Enklu Node SDK

We have created a new [Open Source SDK](https://github.com/enklu/enklu-node-sdk) to help external devices communicate with your experiences.  Connect buttons, talk to your own servers, or even sync your stage lighting! [See our guide](Scripting/NodeSDK) to get started.

### Improvements

interpolation.
